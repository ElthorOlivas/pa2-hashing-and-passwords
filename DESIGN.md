1. While researching for 2 other ways to crack passwords I found this two very famous ones Leet speak and Suffixes. Leet speaks substitutes letters in the password with numbers or special characters that resemble those letters and I would implemet it to generate various passwords to try and find the correct one. Suffixes is a strategy based on common user behavior patterns where users tend to add characters to fulfill password policy requirement and I would modify my code and implemented by literating through each password and try adding these prefixes and suffixes to create new variations.

2. Adding all up (Password buffer, Given hash,Intermediate has buffer) I got a total of 350 bytes to execute the cracker. Based on my previous response I can say password craker is speed-limited due to the repetitiveness that it may take to find the correct password.
